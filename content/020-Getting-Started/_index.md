# Use Cases
## Supervisor
At any given point during a shift, a supervisor in the contact center might want to answer some combination of the following questions at a glance:
- How many customer conversations are waiting to be answered?
- How many of my agents are currently connected with customers?
- What is my abandoned rate today?
- How are we tracking against our published SLA (Service Level Agreement)?
- What are my agents doing right now as it relates to their status in Genesys Cloud CX?

Knowing these answers at a glance allows the supervisor to decide if any action is needed. Depending on the information available, a supervisor might make a decision  such as:
- Ask some agents to wait to go on break
- Decide whether or not it is a good time for an impromptu meeting with some agents.
- Etc.
## Wallboard
Wallboards are commonly used in contact centers with physical brick and mortar locations. They are typically placed on larger screens so that, regardless of where you are in the center, agents, supervisors and other staff can see whatâ€™s happening at a glance and from a distance with ease. 

When anyone in the contact center looks at the wallboard, they can immediately know if this is a good time to do something such as:
- Take a break if breaks do not need to be scheduled.
- Return to their desk because calls waiting, which means customers waiting, has increased.
- Etc.

Now that you have some basic understanding of the Use Cases for Supervisors and Wallboards in your contact center, let's take a look at how to solve for them.
